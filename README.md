### Description
The repository is created to contain the core `.py` file as well as other files. The main function is to gain the information in the website of our internal server.    
The `.csv` file named ['test.csv'](./test.csv 'tested results') is the example running result of the main code in file 'crawlserver.py'.    
### How to use
###### Step 1
You can clone the package to some kind of path in your PC, then open the `cmd` and change path to where you contain the `.py` file.     
###### Step 2
After success, type the name of the .py file('crawlserver.py') to the panel and press `Enter` to run.    
###### Step3
First, the system want to know which `.csv` file you'll contain your running result. There are two conditions:    
1. If you need to save the running result to other path instead of the current path, you should provide the whole path like `C:\Program Files\test`, remember not to press the extension name(`.csv` is not needed), **test** is the .csv name which should be contained in the path.    
2. And if you just want to put the results in the current path, press the `.csv` file name only(like `test`).    
###### Step4
After the process, data will be crawled from the website and saved to the `.csv` file you typed before automatically.    
### Statement
It is provided only to the insider, other people please don't attempt to clone the code since there is no use to do that. This is the internal demand. Thank you for your cooperation.
